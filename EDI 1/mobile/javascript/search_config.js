In        order  to  commemorate  and  pay  tribute  to  this  great        visionary    every    year    our    college    conducts         \"Hahnemann's day\".          Hahnemann's journey was one of relentless pursuit of        truth,  of  efficacy,  and  above  all,  of  compassion.  In  a        world  entrenched  in  conventional  medical  practices,        he  dared  to  question,  to  explore,  and  to  innovate.        Through his unwavering dedication, he unearthed the        fundamental  principles  of  homeopathy—a  system  of        medicine that treats the individual, not just the disease.        By advocating for the principle of \"like cures like\" and        the concept of potentization, he unlocked the inherent        healing potential of nature itself.                           Celebrating the legacy of                        Dr Samuel Hanemann              He  was  a  humanitarian,  a  scholar,  and  a  beacon  of  hope  for  those  in  need.  In  an  era  marred  by         uncertainty and despair, he offered solace and healing, reminding us all of the profound impact that         one individual can have on the world.           In  the  words  of  Samuel  Hahnemann  himself,  \"The  highest  ideal  of  cure  is  rapid,  gentle,  and         permanent restoration of health.\" May we carry forth this ideal in our hearts and in our practice,         ensuring that the flame of healing he ignited continues to burn brightly for generations to come.          www.alvashomoeopathy.com                                                                               01","CELEBRATING                  THE SUCCESS OF                   OUR STUNNING FLAIRS.
